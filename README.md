## Problem Statement

Agriculture today faces several challenges:
- Lack of trust and transparency between stakeholders.
- No proof of proper farming conditions, leading to wrongful accusations.
- Limited access to reliable, data-driven decision-making tools.

## Our Solution

We leverage IoT-enabled agriculture combined with Web 3 integration to create a robust platform for monitoring and managing farm conditions:
- *Real-time Monitoring*: Continuous data collection from various sensors.
- *Blockchain Storage*: Immutable records stored on IPFS, ensuring tamper-proof data.
- *Smart Contracts*: Automated updates and audits for all farm operations.

## Key Features

- *IoT Sensors*: Utilizes ultrasonic, soil temperature, water level, moisture, rainfall, and NPK sensors.
- *Automation*: Automatically manages irrigation and nutrient dosing based on real-time data.
- *Transparent Record-Keeping*: Immutable records on the blockchain provide legal protection for farmers.
- *Data Accessibility*: Stakeholders can access real-time data and historical records through an intuitive dashboard.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agriculture-base-africa.git
   cd agriculture-base-africa
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:** Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   You will be prompted by your wallet (MetaMask or similar) to confirm the transaction for gas fees.

2. **Interact with the Smart Contract:**
   - Use the `updateCID.js` script to update the IPFS CID for the latest sensor data:
   ```bash
   node updateCID.js
   ```
   - Confirm the transaction prompt in your MetaMask wallet when updating the CID.

## Future Enhancements

- *Automatic Alerts*: Notifications for critical thresholds (e.g., low water levels).
- *Gas Fee Estimation*: Display gas fee estimates before transactions.
- *Offline Functionality*: Access sensor data offline.
- *Data Visualizations*: Implement charts for data trends over time.
